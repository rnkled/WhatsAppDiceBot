# WhatsAppDiceBot
My First Attempt to Create a Bot to roll dices on Whatsapp Groups Using Python and Selenium.

To Use it: 
Set your ChromeDriver path on the Script. Run it. Log in in your WhatsApp Account on the Selenium Browser window and enter the group that you want to monitor.
Then, Just do Commands like "/roll 3d6, /r 2d10, /role 5d10", and he will roll it.
