# WhatsAppDiceBot
A Simple Bot created to roll dices on Whatsapp Groups Using Python and Selenium.

To Use it: 
Set your ChromeDriver path on the Script. Run it. Then Log in on your WhatsApp Account on the Selenium Browser and enter the group that you want to monitor.
Then you just need to do Commands in the chat like "/roll 3d6, /r 2d10, /role 5d10", and he will roll it for you and anyone else on the group.
